moves-exporter
==============

A couple of hacky scripts to export data from the Moves API[1].

usage
-----

   ./getcode                         # Returns "code" in redirect URL
   ./gettoken <code>                 # Returns "access_token" in payload
   export USER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access_token>
   ./getprofile                      # Returns (amongst other stuff) "firstDate"
   ./getalldata <firstDate>

`getalldata` will only download data up to yesterday, and will not download
files that already exist in the `data/` directory. In order to redownload the
data for a day, simply delete the data file in `data/`.
